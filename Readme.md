# Car details

## Fetching the data

It is like a step by step process to get the data

1. We need the brand name. So I created a dropdown to get the input.
2. Then I appended the brand name in the url for the next step to display the available models in that particular brand
3. With the model name, respective id is appended to the url to get the manufacturing year for that model.
4. After selecting the year, the year code has been appended to the url, to get the vehicle details. I displayed the vehicle details in dynamic manner
5. Added some styling and responsiveness to all the elements with bootstrap and stylesheet
